cloud.ca uses a utility billing model to charges you only for the resources that you actually use. To help you keep an eye on your usage, we provide a convenient usage report which can be generated at any time to see your service usage and associated expenses.

1. In the menu bar, click **Usage**.
1. Select the environment for which to run the report, or leave **All** to generate a global report covering all environments within your organization.
1. Select the desired time period through one of the predefined selections or by specifying a *start* and *end* date.
1. Click on **Generate**.

Keep in mind there *will* be minor differences between the values in this report and your final monthly bill, because some usage types cannot be tracked through this report, namely:

- License fee of NetScaler virtual appliances or Windows SPLA (if applicable)
- Backup & monitoring fees (Managed customers only)
