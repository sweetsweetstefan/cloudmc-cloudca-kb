According to Wikipedia, **Two-Factor Authentication** (also known as **2FA**) provides unambiguous identification of users by means of the combination of two different components. These components may be something that the user knows, something that the user possesses or something that is inseparable from the user.

In the context of cloud.ca, this is achieved by leveraging the user's smartphone or laptop as a token. Combined with a username and password, that gives us a two-factor authentication.

### Install a token generator

On your smartphone, you have to install a token generator in order for the process to work. cloud.ca does work well with the Google Authenticator or Authy application. Both are available free of charge for Android or iPhone. If you do not own a smartphone, these software have a version for desktop computers.

Refer to the application-specific documentation about how to install it on your device.

### Turn on Two-Factor Authentication

This is done by accessing your own user preference page. Click on your username on the top right of the application, and then My Profile.

Look towards the bottom of the page, you will see a section about Two Factor Authentication. The workflow is very straightforward. First, click on the **Enable** button as show below.

The system will ask for a password validation to confirm the user's identity. Then, simply follow the on-screen instructions.

Make sure to enter your 6 digit code from your token generator to confirm the process worked. Then click on **Verify and Save**. This will open a new window showing you 8 backup codes. These backup codes are your safety net in case you loose or change your phone. So you won't be locked out and will be able to re-configure the authentication. ***MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THESE IN A SAFE PLACE***.

Once you've clicked **Close**, you will your token each time you re-authenticate yourself on the platform.

### Regenerate your backup codes

If for whatever reason you should lose your backup codes, your codes can be re-generated.  This is also done via the user preferences page.  Click on the button **Regenerate backup codes** in the **Security** section.  A dialog box with your new codes will appear so that you can take note or print them out.

### Deactivate Two-Factor Authentication

If you wish to deactivate two-factor authentication on your account, go to **My profile** and under the **Security** section, click on **Disable two-factor authentication**.  You will be asked to enter your password.  Once this is done, you will be asked only for your username and password when authenticating yourself to cloud.ca.
